# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.

```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```

After skimming the data, wer can see that there are no missing values in the dataset.
The variable types are:

+---------------+-----------+---------------+-----------------+---------------+------------------------------+
| Column name   | country   | beer_servings | spirit_servings | wine_servings | total_litres_of_pure_alcohol |
+===============+===========+===============+=================+===============+==============================+
| Variable type | character | integer       | integer         | integer       | double                       |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+-----------------+---------------+------------------------------+

```{r glimpse_skim_data}

glimpse(drinks)
skim(drinks)
```

We will now make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries-

```{r beer_plot}
drinks %>% 
  slice_max ( order_by = beer_servings, n=25 ) %>% # taking top 25 countries by servings
  #plotting a graph 
  ggplot(aes(x = beer_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, beer_servings))) +
  geom_col(fill="orange") +
  #labelling the graph and the axes
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries in 2010",
    subtitle = "Standard Servings Per Person",
    x = "Beer Servings (in cans)",
    y = "Country"
  )
```
We will now make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries-

```{r wine_plot}
drinks %>% 
  slice_max ( order_by = wine_servings, n=25 ) %>% # taking top 25 countries by servings
  ggplot(aes(x = wine_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, wine_servings))) +
  geom_col(fill="dark red") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries in 2010",
    subtitle = "Standard Servings Per Person",
    x = "Wine Servings (in glasses)",
    y = "Country"
  )
```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}
drinks %>% 
  slice_max ( order_by = spirit_servings, n=25 ) %>% # taking top 25 countries by servings
  ggplot(aes(x = spirit_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, spirit_servings))) +
  geom_col(fill="grey") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 Spirit Consuming Countries in 2010",
    subtitle = "Servings (in shots) Per Person",
    x = "Spirit Servings",
    y = "Country"
  )

```
> Inferences & Key takeaways-

1.  European countries are high consumers of wine.

2.  Beer is more evenly distributed around the world in the top 25 countries, as compared to wine and spirit.

3.  European countries are higher ranked for overall consumption of beer, wine and spirit.

4. We see the countries with higher population are lower on the graphs, since the data is plotted per population. Hence the distribution of ages in the population within each country will also affect the alcohol, wine and spirits consumption. 

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

-   `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
-   `budget`: The movie's budget
-   `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast members received
-   `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB
-   `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
-   `rating`: IMDB average rating

## Import, inspection, and cleaning of dataset-

From the dataset, we can see that:
1.  There are no missing values in the dataset.
2.  The movies with duplicated entries. There are Duplicates (2907 distinct titles in 2961 rows)
The following piece of code shows how we have cleaned it.

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

# no missing values. There are Duplicates (2907 distinct titles in 2961 rows). 
skim(movies)
# show the duplicate movies
movies %>% count(title, sort=T)
# to see what happens with the duplicates
movies %>% filter(title=="Homes")

# `distinct` function can only keep the first entry but not latest
# movies <- distinct(movies, title, .keep_all=T)
length(unique(movies$title))

movies <- movies %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  filter(votes == max(votes)) %>%
  ungroup()

# there are still duplicates
movies %>% count(title, sort=T)
# to see what happens with the duplicates
movies %>% filter(title=="Chasing Liberty")
# do the filter only for the entries of Chasing Liberty 
movies <- movies %>%
  group_by(title) %>% 
  filter(cast_facebook_likes==max(cast_facebook_likes)) %>%
  ungroup()

skim(movies)

```


The following table shows the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order

```{r}
movies %>% count(genre, sort = TRUE)

```

Here we have a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. 
We have calculated a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many \$ did a movie make at the box office for each \$ of its budget. We have ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order-

```{r}

movies %>% 
  mutate(movies_return = gross/budget ) %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(avg_gross = mean(gross),
            avg_budget = mean(budget),
            genre_return_on_budget = sum(gross)/sum(budget),
            movie_mean_return_on_budget = mean(movies_return)) %>%
  arrange(-movie_mean_return_on_budget)
  


```

Here we have a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. We have shown the total gross amount, the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r}
movies %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(total_gross = sum(gross),
            mean_gross = mean(gross),
            median_gross = median(gross),
            standard_dev_gross = sd(gross)) %>%
  slice_max ( order_by = total_gross, n = 15)
  
```

We have produced a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. The histogram visually shows how ratings are distributed.

```{r}
movies_rating <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
            min_rating = min(rating),
             max_rating = max(rating),
             sd_rating = sd(rating)) 
movies_rating

```

```{r}
movies %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=30) +
  facet_wrap(~genre)+
  labs(title = "Distribution of ratings in each genre",
       x = "Rating (1-10)",
       y = "Num of movies") +
  NULL

```

## Using `ggplot` to find relationships between variables

Understanding the correlation between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. 
We have produced a scatterplot with Facebook Likes on the X-Axis and Gross Revenue on the Y-Axis. 

```{r, gross_on_fblikes, warnings=FALSE, messeges=FALSE}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = cast_facebook_likes, y = gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
   labs(
    title = "Relationship of Facebook Likes vs Gross Revenue of the Movie",
    x = "Facebook Likes",
    y = "Gross Revenue"
  )+
  NULL

```
We analyze the following from the graph below- 

1.  Facebook likes do not seem like a good indicator of the gross as there is no direct correlation as seen from the scatter plot.
2.  We mapped gross to Y axes and number of facebook likes to X, because the gross is the final outcome of a movie, aka dependent variable.

Now we examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget` by creating a scatterplot.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = budget , y = gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
   labs(
    title = "Relationship of Gross Revenue vs Budget of the Movie",
    x = "Movie Budget",
    y = "Gross Revenue"
  )+
  NULL
```

From the plot above we see that, the budget and gross do seem correlated. The higher the budget, it is more likely that the gross may be higher.

Furthermore, we examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. 
Segmenting the scatterplot by 'genre', we can see the following results-

```{r, gross_on_rating, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating , y = gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  labs(title = "Gross vs Rating of Movies For Each Genre ",
       x = "Rating",
       y = "Gross") +
  NULL

```

We can see that:

-   The higher the rating the more will be the gross for the most genres of movies.

-   For movies of some genres like 'Documentary', 'Mystery', 'Horror' and 'Sci-Fi', the gross has a very less change with respect to rating. Documentaries certainly have a different business model.

-   Negative correlation even appears.

-   Sample size of genres like 'Family', 'Romance' , 'Musical' is very small with under three values. 

# Returns of financial stocks

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns.

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.

```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))

glimpse(nyse)

```

Based on this dataset, we have created a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}

# a easier way
# nyse %>% 
#   select(sector) %>% 
#   table() %>%
#   sort(decreasing = T) %>%
#   barplot()

nyse %>%
  group_by(sector) %>% 
  mutate(company_num = count(sector)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=company_num, y=fct_reorder(sector, company_num))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Companies in each Sector",
       x = "",
       y = "Sector")

```

Next, we have chosen some stocks and their ticker symbols and downloaded data.
The stocks we chose are: "EBR","BBL","AEE","BCE","BRO","CAT","BUD","SPY"

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument inthe chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, 
# cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- c("EBR","BBL","AEE","BCE","BRO","CAT","BUD","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2021-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

We can see that the dataset is 8x21,464 tibble with each row being the ohlc (open,high,low,close) and volume for a stock on a given date.

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

We have created a table summarising monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}
glimpse(myStocks_returns_monthly)

monthlystocks_summarised <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  summarise(min_return = min(monthly_returns),
            max_return = max(monthly_returns),
            median_return = median(monthly_returns),
            mean_return = mean(monthly_returns),
            sd_return = sd(monthly_returns))
```

Plotted a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks

```{r density_monthly_returns}

ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x = monthly_returns)) +
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~symbol) +
  labs(
    title = "Density Plots for Monthly Returns of Stocks",
    x = "Monthly Return",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  NULL

```


> Inferences from the plots

The monthly returns for the flatter density plots are more dispersed whereas those with tall peaks are more concentrated. The riskiest stock is EBR and the least risky is SPY (as an ETF) due to the shape of their peaks.

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}

monthlystocks_summarised%>%
  ggplot(aes(y = mean_return, x=sd_return)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = symbol)) +
  NULL
   

```


> Inferences from the plots

EBR is the most risky as it has the highest standard deviation of returns. EBR has the highest sd but also a high expected return. AEE, CAT and SPY also have high expected returns with less standard deviation. BBL and BUD have lower expected returns and higher standard deviations meaning they are riskier and do not have high expected returns. SPY produces a good return with lower risk.

# IBM HR Analytics

We analyse a data set on Human Resource Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.

First let us load the data:

```{r}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

Cleaning the data:

```{r}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

```{r}
glimpse(hr_cleaned)
```


1.  How often do people leave the company (`attrition`)

```{r}
# 1233 employees stay while 237 left (19.2%).
hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(attrition)%>% 
  summarise(count = count(attrition))

# to see the how attrition rate changes with years at company
prop.table(table(hr_cleaned[,c("years_at_company","attrition")]),1)[,2]%>%
  barplot(main="Attrition Rate vs Years At Company" , xlab="Years at Company" , ylab="Attrition Rate")
abline(h=0.192,col="red") # avergae attrition rate

```

-   As we can see from the above table only around 20% of the employees in the dataset left the company during their working years. This shows that employees do not leave that often.

2.  After analyzing the `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion`, we can see from the histograms from the summary statistics, the only variable that looks normally distributed is age.

```{r}
skim(hr_cleaned)
```

3. We now analyse the distirbutions of `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` 

```{r}
hr_cleaned %>%  
  group_by(job_satisfaction)%>% 
  summarise(countjs = n(),
            percentagejs = countjs/nrow(hr_cleaned)*100)


hr_cleaned %>%  
  group_by(work_life_balance)%>% 
  summarise(countwlb= n(),
            percentagewlb = round(countwlb/nrow(hr_cleaned)*100,2))
```

-   Job satisfaction is distributed quite evenly however the categories of High and Very High are more common with around 30% each. In terms of work life balance very few people have Bad or the Best work life balance. The majority of people have better work life balance.

4. We now check for the relationship between monthly income vs education and Monthly income vs gender

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = fct_relevel(education, 
            "Doctor", "Master", "Bachelor", 
            "College", "Below College"), y = monthly_income)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Monthly Income against Education",
       x = "Education",
       y = "Monthly Income")+
  NULL

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = monthly_income, y = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Monthly Income against Gender",
       x = "Monthly Income",
       y = "Gender")+
  NULL
```

-   As we can see from the boxplot of males and females and their monthly income, females have a higher median monthly income which could mean that the females in the dataset could be more educated. The doctors have the highest monthly median income and those with below college education have the least. Doctors also have the highest variability in the IQR. College has the most outliers due to its low standard deviation.

5.  We now plot a boxplot of income vs job role. The highest-paid job roles appear first.

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=fct_reorder(job_role,-monthly_income), y=monthly_income)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Monthly Income against Job Role",
       x = "Job Role",
       y = "Monthly Income")+
  NULL
```

6.  Calculate and plot a bar chart of the mean (or median?) income by education level.

```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise(medianinc = median(monthly_income),
            meaninc = mean(monthly_income)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_relevel(education, 
            "Doctor", "Master", "Bachelor", 
            "College", "Below College"),
            y=meaninc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Average Monthly Income of Each Education Level",
       x = "Education",
       y = "Average Monthly Income")+
  NULL
```

-   As we can see the medians and means differ greatly, this is due to the outliers in the dataset with individuals with abnormally high monthly income levels.

7.  We plot the distribution of income by education level.

```{r}

hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=monthly_income)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30)+
  facet_wrap(~fct_relevel(education, 
            "Doctor", "Master", "Bachelor", 
            "College", "Below College")) +
  theme_wsj() +
  NULL

```

8.  Graph showing income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

```{r, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE}

hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=monthly_income, x=age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  facet_wrap(~job_role) +
  theme_wsj() +
  NULL

```

# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor). The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian.

The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.

```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )


german_election_polls %>% 
  ggplot() +
  # union
  geom_point(aes(x=end_date,y=union, colour="UNION"),shape=21)+

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
